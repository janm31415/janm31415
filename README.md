Hello, I'm Jan Maes, a software developer from Belgium.

Most of my hobby software projects I host on my GitHub page. I typically write in C++, although I try to learn some C, Scheme, Swift and Python.

Apart from programming, I'm also an enthusiastic guitar, bass, and piano player. Some music I recorded can be found
